# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL. It explores two main datasets, namely COVID Deaths and COVID Vaccinations, which were sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations). 

## Data Sources

- COVID Deaths Data: Sourced from [Our World in Data - COVID Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- COVID Vaccinations Data: Sourced from [Our World in Data - COVID Vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

## Skills Demonstrated

Throughout this project, I have showcased several key SQL skills, including:

- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Converting Data Types

## Insights Uncovered
The project utilized various SQL queries to uncover various insights. A few notable queries included:

- Calculated the likelihood of dying after contracting COVID-19 by country.
- Focused on the United Kingdom to determine the likelihood of death after contracting COVID-19.
- Evaluated the percentage of a population infected with COVID-19.
- Identified countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.
- Explored countries with the highest death count per population.
- Analyzed continents with the highest death count per population.
- Calculated global COVID-19 numbers, including daily new cases and death percentages.
- Explored the percentage of the global population that has received at least one vaccination using both CAST and CONVERT methods.
